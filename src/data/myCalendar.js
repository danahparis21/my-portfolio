    "A scheduling platform with drag-and-drop events, recurring reminders, and role-based access built in PHP and JavaScript.",

  description: `
## Purpose
This project was created to address the need for a flexible, user-friendly calendar system that helps individuals and organizations manage schedules, deadlines, and events in one centralized platform. The goal was to replace paper-based or disconnected scheduling tools with an intuitive web-based solution that supports recurring events, personalized reminders, and multi-role access. It was designed with usability and real-world application in mind, making it suitable for schools, teams, and personal productivity systems.

## My Role
I led the design and development of the front-end interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, and building the server-side logic using PHP and MySQL. I implemented key features like drag-and-drop scheduling using JavaScript, real-time updates, and secure user authentication. I also integrated PHPMailer for automated email reminders and created an admin dashboard to manage users, announcements, and audit logs. I handled database design, optimized queries, and ensured the system could scale to support multiple users with role-based permissions.

## Key Features
- Create single or recurring events with custom color tags  
- Drag-and-drop scheduling with real-time updates  
- Set email and system reminders for upcoming events  
- Track event status: Completed, Pending, Cancelled  
- Export event data to Excel  
- Role-based access: Admin and User  
- Admin dashboard for announcements, logs, and user control  
- Audit trail to track event changes and user actions

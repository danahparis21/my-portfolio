  shortDescription:
    "A Java Swing-based system for QR code attendance tracking using webcam scanning and real-time student logging.",

  description: `
## Purpose
To replace manual student attendance with a real-time, contactless system using QR code scanning and webcam integration.

## My Role
I built this application from scratch using Java Swing, integrating webcam functionality and QR code generation. The system includes role-based dashboards, real-time logging, and a connected MySQL database for persistent storage.

## Key Features
- Student registration with QR code generation  
- QR code scanning using a webcam for attendance logging  
- Role-based access for Admins and Students  
- Real-time attendance records and search  
- Profile updates and data export to CSV  
- Visual feedback during scanning and logging

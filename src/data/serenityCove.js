  title: "Serenity Cove – Resort Management System",
  shortDescription:
    "A full-featured Java Swing application for managing resort bookings, guest data, and analytics via real-time dashboards.",

  description: `
## Purpose
This project was built to streamline the front desk and administrative operations of a resort. The system supports multiple amenities (rooms, cottages, pools, services) and includes visual analytics for tracking revenue, popular services, and guest demographics.

## My Role
I developed the entire user interface and logic for the Reception Dashboard and Guest Form using Java Swing. I implemented features such as room filtering, real-time billing based on guest selections, and deposit validation. I also handled receipt generation using the AWT Print API and integrated XChart for dynamic analytics. My responsibilities included database design, price calculations, and developing features that ensured smooth coordination between guests, services, and resort staff.

## Key Features
- Book rooms, cottages, pools, and additional services  
- Dynamic price calculation by room type and stay duration  
- View facilities, auto-fetch room details, and show availability  
- Real-time billing with deposit and change computation  
- Role-based access for receptionists and admins  
- Guest tracking by status (Checked In, Unpaid, Checked Out)  
- Printable receipts upon checkout  
- Visual charts for admin analytics (revenue, guest trends, service popularity)

## Tech Stack
Java Swing · MySQL · AWT Print API · XChart
